# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for my submission for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program final project. 

This includes the Image Classifier Project (as both .html and .ipynb) where the methods were initially developed.

It also includes train.py a CLI which loads a pretrained image classifier and then trains it to identify flower images and predict.py which utilizes the trained model to identify flowers from photos.
